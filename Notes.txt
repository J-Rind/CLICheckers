Checkers â€“ CLI Based Checkers Game - Rules
=======================================================================================================================
Checkers - CLI based Checkers Game.
basic rules:
    1. 2 players
        a. Red
        b. Black
    2. Black player moves first
    3. One board per game
    4. 12 pieces for each player
    5. Players place their pieces on the 12 dark squares in the first three rows closest to player.
    6. Each of these rows should have a total of 4 pieces.
    7. The back row (row closest to the player) is the KING ROW.
    8. Pieces may only move 1 diagonal place forward towards their opponet.
    9. Pieces must stay on the dark squares.
    10. Capturing pieces is achieved by jumping over it.
    11. The space on the other side of the piece you intend to capture must be empty.
    12. You can chain together jumps as long as the above criteria is met.
    13. If your piece makes it to the very back row you make re-take one capture piece and crown the piece you made it
    to the other side of the board with. This is piece is no a King piece.
    14. King pieces may still only move one space at a time during non-capturing moves. However, when capturing pieces
    the king can move diagonally forward or backwards.
    15. There is no limit to the amount of king pieces a player may have.

Board:

What does my board need to provide? The board needs to be printed in some default state, say the initial setup of a
checkers game. The board needs to be able to be printed in it's current state; where pieces are right now. The board
should also provide a method to add a piece to the board somewhere, and remove the piece from the board. At a high level
this is what our board class should provide.

Diving a little deeper we need to consider the HOW of providing this to other developers. Let's discuss the details

1. We need to be able to create a board from our class. This can be accomplished with a general constructor.
2. We need to be able to print the board at any time for our user. Let's first print a blank board.

So at a bare minimum I want to accomplish printing an empty board; even if it's literally just empty and all NULL.

If I start thinking about that process something comes to mind, a board is made up of squares that intersect by row &
column (x,y). I'll create a class called Square or position; something along those lines.

This class would at a minimum have some coordinates, and a data type of a piece. We'll also need a method to set a piece
on that square. So while overall we're broadly touching "the board" the board is itself made up of squares. So, with that
in mind what I really want to do is create a board object, and then print out all the squares and whatever pieces might
exist on them.

Let's assume I'm just developing the board, not pieces. How can I go about doing this without a Piece class? Let's setup
a generic Piece class that literally just contains a string, a name for the piece. We can even, at this point just print
strings on the board. We can still get the same performance; though we'd need to come back to this and modify our methods
later once we have our piece class.

What should my board class have:

Board:

1. Data:
    1a. Squares (we'll create several squares for our board)
    2a. game pieces

2. Methods:
    2a. A general constructor
    2b. A setBoard method to setup our board.
    2c. A showBoard method to display the board.
    2d. A setPiece to set a piece on a square
    2e. A removePiece to remove a piece from the square.


Generally speaking, this is how I'd think about the board. This may change as we dive in and I start to think about
other aspects (pieces, moves, etc).

At the end of the day, the board shouldn't care if the pieces move is valid (it'd be great if it did); it just needs to
provide some method of adding a piece to our board.
